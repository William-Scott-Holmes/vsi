# About dedicated virtual servers
{: #dedicated-virtual-servers}

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} infrastructure dedicated host offering is a virtualized, single-tenant, dedicated server. It provides you with maximum control over workload placement and flexible post-provisioning options. You can decide which pre-determined {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center your virtual servers are placed in and can be assured capacity by allocating your host(s) directly to your account.
{:shortdesc}

The offering includes the following features:

* Affinity and anti-affinity. You can specify host-to-virtual server and virtual server-to-virtual server relationships that should remain, which are known as affinity and anti-affinity rules. These rules help you make sure that your workloads are placed appropriately based on your workload requirements.
* Post-deployment management. You can migrate virtual servers between dedicated hosts based on your workload requirements.
* Workload visibility. You can view resource consumption—core, RAM, and local storage—for each host, giving you maximum control over your workload management.

You have the choice of two deployment models: dedicated hosts and dedicated instances. Dedicated hosts help with control over workload placement and dedicated instances offer single-tenant isolation.

Dedicated instances do not provide some of the control features offered by dedicated hosts.  See the following table for more details.

<sup>(1)</sup>Pricing of host is inclusive of core, RAM, Local SSD, and network speeds. Premium operating system (OS), storage area network (SAN) storage, and software add-ons will be priced per instance with existing pricing and licensing in an hourly or monthly model.

Keep in mind the following when you’re ordering a dedicated host(s) and dedicated host instances:

* The size of your host(s) is determined by your workloads that you will be running on it. The default is 56 Cores X 242 GB RAM X 1.2 TB, but you can choose from additional configurations.
* You can order only two hosts at a time. For example, if you need six hosts, you will need to place three separate orders.
* Each host will need its own unique name and you can automatically assign your POD.
* Network speeds up to 20 Gbps are achievable through additional configuration. For more information about network performance, see [Configuring virtual server settings for improved network performance](/docs/vsi?topic=virtual-servers-configuring-network-performance).

After you have reviewed and decided upon your deployment options, it is time to provision your virtual server. To get started, see [Provisioning dedicated hosts and instances](/docs/vsi?topic=virtual-servers-ordering-vs-dedicated).
