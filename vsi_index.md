# Getting started with virtual servers
{: #getting-started-tutorial}

You can deploy {{site.data.keyword.BluVirtServers}} in a matter of minutes. The virtual servers are deployed from your choice of virtual server images and in the geographic region that makes sense for your workloads.
{:shortdesc}

Try our virtual servers on a virtual private cloud! For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_full}}](/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-getting-started).
{:tip}

When you create a virtual server in the classic infrastructure, you can choose between a public (multi-tenancy) environment or a dedicated (single-tenancy) environment. Then, depending on the chosen environment, you must also select hourly, monthly, or transient virtual servers. In the case of public virtual servers, you also choose to use either SAN-based storage or local storage.

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin-virtual-servers}

Before you begin, review the following prerequisites.

  1. You must have an upgraded account to order virtual servers. This process can take some time and requires your request to be approved before you can continue. For more information about upgrading your account, see [Switching to IBMid](/docs/account?topic=account-unifyingaccounts#unifyingaccounts).
  2. Review and choose your deployment options. For more information, see the following topics:

## Provisioning a virtual server
{: #provisioning-a-virtual-server-getting-started}

After you decide upon a deployment option, begin the provisioning process.

## Next steps
{: #next-steps-getting-started}

After your virtual server is provisioned and available to use, you can configure your virtual servers by using the
{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. For more information, see [Configuring virtual servers](/docs/vsi?topic=virtual-servers-configuring-virtual-servers).
